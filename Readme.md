Vulnerability Report Generator Documentation
1. Project Overview
The Vulnerability Report Generator is a Flask-based web application designed to streamline the process of generating vulnerability reports for pentesters. The application allows users to input critical information about a security assessment, including details of vulnerabilities, assets tested, tools used, and more. The generated report can be exported in various formats like DOCX, PDF, or encrypted PDF.

2. Features
User-friendly web interface with Bootstrap integration.
Form-based report generation with options to add vulnerabilities dynamically.
Supports file uploads for screenshots, logos, and other attachments.
Multi-format export options (DOCX, PDF, Encrypted PDF).
Automatic numbering and organization of vulnerabilities and report sections.

3. Technologies Used
Flask: Backend framework for handling HTTP requests and serving the application.
Werkzeug: Utility for file handling and security.
python-docx: Library for generating Word documents programmatically.
docx2pdf: Utility for converting DOCX files to PDF format.
Bootstrap: CSS framework for creating a responsive and modern UI.
Matplotlib & Pandas: For generating charts or handling data (if needed in future features).
HTML & JavaScript: For frontend and dynamic form interactions.

4. Installation Guide
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You also need pip to install the required packages.

Steps
Clone the repository:
bash(Copy code):
git clone https://github.com/VikrantCodes/vulnerability-report-generator.git
cd vulnerability-report-generator
Create a virtual environment and activate it:
bash(Copy code):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:
bash(Copy code):
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:
bash(Copy code):
flask run
Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

5. Usage Guide
Open the web interface in your browser.
Fill in the details like Report Title, Client Name, Prepared By, Date, etc.
Add details of the vulnerabilities found during the assessment. You can dynamically add more vulnerabilities by clicking "Add Vulnerability".
Choose the export format (DOCX, PDF, Encrypted PDF, or Both).
Click "Generate Report" to download the generated report.
Adding Vulnerabilities
For each vulnerability, you can specify:
Name of the vulnerability.
Severity level (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
Description.
Affected asset.
Detailed steps to reproduce, including screenshots.
Mitigation recommendations.
Status (Open or Closed).

6. Code Explanation
Key Files
app.py: The main Flask application file.
templates/index.html: HTML form used to capture user input for the report.
static/: Folder containing CSS/JS files.
Important Functions
allowed_file(filename): Checks if the uploaded file type is allowed.
index(): Renders the HTML form for report generation.
generate_report(): Handles form submission, processes the input, and generates the report using python-docx. Optionally, it converts the report to PDF using docx2pdf.
Dynamic Form Handling with JavaScript
The frontend dynamically adds vulnerabilities using JavaScript and allows for the addition of multiple steps within each vulnerability.

7. Export Options
DOCX: A Word document is generated using python-docx.
PDF: The DOCX file is converted to PDF using docx2pdf.
Encrypted PDF: The PDF can be encrypted (this feature can be extended).

8. Customization & Extensions
The application can be extended to include more detailed sections or customized report templates.
Integration with existing pentesting tools and automation pipelines.
Custom encryption or obfuscation options for sensitive reports.

9. Troubleshooting & FAQs
Common Issues
File upload errors: Ensure that the uploaded files are in the allowed formats (e.g., PNG, JPG, PDF).
Dependencies not found: Make sure all dependencies are installed using the correct Python environment.
FAQ
Can I use this tool for different types of assessments?
Yes, the tool can be customized for various security assessments like web applications, network pentests, etc.

How can I change the template of the generated report?
Modify the generate_report() function in app.py to customize the structure and style of the DOCX file.

10. Future Enhancements
Adding support for more file formats and report templates.
Enhancing the UI with more styling and a wizard-style interface for step-by-step report generation.
Integration with pentesting frameworks like Metasploit or Burp Suite.
